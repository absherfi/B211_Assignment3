The purpose of this project is to create a list of the top 100 players and corresponding season for each of your calculated metrics: field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, free throw accuracy, average points scored per game, overall shooting accuracy, average blocks per game, and average steals per game. Field goal accuracy, three point accuracy, free throw accuracy, points per minute, average blocks per game, and steals per game for each player was calculated starting by creating arrays for each of the columns. From there, the stats stated before as well as overall shooting accuracy, were calculated using basic mathematic functions.
